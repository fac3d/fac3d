  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    With a lifetime of technical experience and as a Software Engineer as my day job, learning how to improve or automate satellite ground systems is what I do. One such accomplishment was a trivial solution I found to transfer mission critical files from Windows to UNIX over a large area network ‚Äî half way across the planet. This trivial solution solved a significant file transfer problem where secure copy (SSH) was not 100% reliable.
  </p>

  <p>
    My background is technical, with a history in component-level troubleshooting and repair of Avionics Systems and as a senior electronics technician working on test range instrumentation systems. These experiences, combined with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics, inspired me to become a Software Engineer. Later, a Master's in Business Organizational Management provided the ‚Äúbig picture element‚Äù that helped me grow into a senior role.

    It's not all work. With an interest in past and language preservation, I find time to learn conversational Hawaiian. I do this because the language is beautiful and is of the highest level of respect for the culture. It is a challenge, and the rewards are great. Imagine being in the islands and greeting a speaker of this language in a conversational context ‚Äî it brings happiness.

    Other interests include wonderful dogs, model railroading, and the great outdoors ‚Äî especially if the ocean is involved.
